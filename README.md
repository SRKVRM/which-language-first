# Which Programming Language Should I Learn First? An Interactive Website

## Summary
(currently wip)

I've seen many people asking, "Which language should I learn first?" when it comes to programming. Some have an idea of what they want to do with it, but some don't.
I created this website using React.js with an interactive quiz based on this flowchart here: http://carlcheo.com/startcoding
While the flowchart is somewhat dated, it still provides a good pointer for beginners who want to get into coding but don't know where to start. 

## Language & Framework Used
This is built in React.js
